Your time in the city will be exciting and full of adventure as you visit temples, food vendors and shopping markets. Many people love visiting Bangkok because it can be relaxing even if you are continuously exploring the city and the sites. And of course, kids love Bangkok too!Cambodia is a small country, but it offers everything. There are two main reasons why you should visit Cambodia: 1) it offers an incredible amount of history and culture; 2) its nature is amazing: it ranges from the gorgeous National Parks to the relaxing islands.They both have amazing street food.</p>

            <p>I really enjoy The Peanuts Movie. It reminds me of the classic Charlie Brown movies, but even better! Even though the Peanuts creator, Charles M. Schulz passed away in 2000, this movie is a tribute to his memory and the legacy that he left behind.While the members of the Peanuts Gang look and act like their lovable selves, there are many updates to this film. The animation is much more detailed than the previous movies and viewers are able to watch it in 3D.I rate The Peanuts Movie 5 out of 5 stars because of the colorful animation and it being true to the original Peanuts Gang. I recommend this movie for ages 3 to 15 or any people who have enjoyed the other Peanuts movies. At the end of this film there is a 3 second clip. The credits are very long so be sure to stick around until the end.</p>

            <p>I've watched Scooby Doo since I was a child and this brought back such feelings. Many movie have been done, but this can bring newer generations to the Scooby ride. This even makes me hope for a new series cause I have to say the last couple either sucked with story and animation or was so far out there it kinda made you head spin. Many people may hate how the story was just focused on Shaggy and Scooby, but I feel like most movies and shows have always done that.Also this animation is one of the best for 3D animation I've seen, since most Scooby shows are really done close to the old animation. It gives the world and all of the old characters more modern feel making the younger generation see them in their world, especially make the Blue Falcon the son of the original.

Lovely to see all the adventures they had gone through and the most wonderful, magical world ever there is. My favorite, Hermoine Granger, Emma Watson is my favorite Harry Potter character. So clever and such a kind and caring friend! U should watch Harry Potter NOW! This story makes me realize that don’t think magic isn’t real. All U do is you have to believe in it

The lack of recognised indigenous land titles means that these areas are seen as empty, making them vulnerable to exploitation. A recent United Nations report warned about the accelerating rate of species extinction that it says is unprecendented in human history. More than a million species are threatened with extinction due to changes in land use including agricultural expansion that comes at the expense of forests like the Amazon.More than 60% of anti-cancer drugs originate from natural sources including rainforest plants, according to research by the International Journal of Oncology. What’s more, the incredible biodiversity of rainforests means there are plenty of other medicines waiting to be discovered – so it’s incredibly important that we stop them going up in flames.</p>
